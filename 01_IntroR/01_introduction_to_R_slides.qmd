## Key features of R

-   Free software
-   Unlike SPSS, there is no graphical interface --- you have to code
-   Pro --- you have a record of what you did
-   Con --- some people find this intimidating
-   R-Studio (also free!) provides a nice interface

## Program for today

1.  Work through the worksheet `introduction to R programming`, available on Moodle.

2.  After you have completed the worksheet you can download one of the two datasets on Moodle (`earnings.csv` and `bechdel.csv`; see the workbook for details)
